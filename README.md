## Project 1: FastAPI REST API
[Project Link](https://github.com/Turtle24/fastapi_project)

**Project At A Glance:**

A FastAPI project built using a weather api and a local instance of a MySQL database in order to explore the framework. I created a database connection, created post, get, put and delete endpoints. JWT, hashing and tokens were implemented for authentication to access the weather endpoints. The project was an exploration project as I wanted to learn more about FastAPI and implement aysncio. I implemented environment variables, requirements.txt and .gitignore in order to apply good practices.

4. jose
5. pydantic
6. starlette


## Project 2: Picture Filter & Quote Overlay
[Project Link](https://github.com/Turtle24/photos_opencv)

**Project At A Glance:**

I wasn't sure what to get my mom for Christmas so I figured I'd create something with some real sentimental value for her. Essentially I pull stoic quotes from a website with beautifulsoup. I then randomize the image, quote and image effect to be used. The image effects are done with opencv and the text overlay is also performed with opencv. The image is then emailed to her via gmail. So once a week she will recieve an image via email. I used environmental variables and gitignore to avoid revealing passwords, used OOP techniques to make the project more Pythonic as this was my first project I completely redid it. I attempted to apply a lot of what I learnt and I intend to add more functionality as time goes on and I learn more.

3. opencv2
4. numpy

## Project 3: Custom Visualizations
[Project Link](https://github.com/Turtle24/CustomViz)

**Project At A Glance:**

I wanted to explore Bokeh, Flask and SQL to create custom visualisations. I used sklearn to run a basic regression on demo data however this project requires a bit of love and treatment as applied to the above. The data is in a local MySQL database and it's just stocks data, I intend to overhaul this over a weekend hover it isn't a priority at the moment thus I've put it on ice. I achieved my exploration goals and I am going to apply what I learnt to my Masters group project.
