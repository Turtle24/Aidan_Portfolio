## Project 1: Picture Filter & Quote Overlay
[Project Link](https://github.com/Turtle24/photos_opencv)

**Project At A Glance:**

I wasn't sure what to get my mom for Christmas so I figured I'd create something with some real sentimental value for her. Essentially I pull stoic quotes from a website with beautifulsoup. I then randomize the image, quote and image effect to be used. The image effects are done with opencv and the text overlay is also performed with opencv. The image is then emailed to her via gmail. So once a week she will recieve an image via email. 

**Python Modules:**

1. beautifulsoup
2. json
3. opencv2
4. numpy
5. TextWrapper
6. email, smtplib, ssl

**To-Do:**

- [x] Scrape quotes from website
- [x] Create filters 
- [x] Apply filters and text to image
- [x] Randomise filters and quotes
- [x] Create email & randomise
- [x] Automate

## Project 3: Custom Visualisation 
[Project Link](https://github.com/Turtle24/CustomViz)

**Project At A Glance:**

End to end custom visualization exploration project. The purpose of this project is to implement an end to end project that allows me to explore visualisation libraries such as brokeh, matplotlib, plotly etc. Setting up an AWS mysql database and essentially hosting everything via technoligies such as Heroku, Google App Engine etc. Exploring html and CSS is also a motivation as I'm curious about how much you can get out of the visualisation libraries as I'm well versed in Power BI and MicroStrategy but the idea of crafting custom visuals is appealing. Finally I want to implement a basic Linear Regression model via Fast API or Flask.

**Technology Used:**

1. AWS 
2. Flask
3. Python
4. Bokeh
5. mySQL

**To-Do:**

- [x] Setup mySQL Local Server
- [x] Push data into MySQL DB
- [x] Setup Flask
- [x] Get Bokeh to work through Flask
- [ ] Clean Up Implementation
