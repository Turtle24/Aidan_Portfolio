[Project Link](https://github.com/Turtle24/photos_opencv)

**Project At A Glance:**

I wasn't sure what to get my mom for Christmas so I figured I'd create something with some real sentimental value for her. Essentially I pull stoic quotes from a website with beautifulsoup. I then randomize the image, quote and image effect to be used. The image effects are done with opencv and the text overlay is also performed with opencv. The image is then emailed to her via gmail. So once a week she will recieve an image via email.
